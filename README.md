# Hospital Management System

A simple Python-based hospital management system that models core entities and workflows, including handling persons (e.g., patients, staff), departments, and operational loops.

## Features

- Define and manage departments and personnel
- Centralized operations and main control logic (`hospital.py`)
- Interactive or automated loops for managing hospital workflows

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher (recommended)
- Optional: Create and activate a `virtualenv`

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or macOS
source venv/bin/activate
````

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DvChege/Hospital_-Management-_System.git
   cd Hospital_-Management-_System
   ```
2. (Optional) Install dependencies, if any:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To execute the main hospital script:

```bash
python hospital.py
```

Depending on program flow, you may also run individual modules for testing or functionality checks:

```bash
python catchup.py
python department.py
python loops.py
python person.py
python persons.py
```
